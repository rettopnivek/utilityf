\title{Function to Draw Ellipses}
\usage{
drawEllipse(a, b, k = 0, Xc = 0, Yc = 0, deg = T, lngth = 100,
  draw = T, ret = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{the length of the x-axis vertice of the ellipse.}

\item{b}{the length of the y-axis vertice of the ellipse.}

\item{k}{the angle between the x-axis in the major vertice
for the ellipse.}

\item{Xc}{the center on the x-axis for the ellipse.}

\item{Yc}{the center on the y-axis for the ellipse.}

\item{deg}{if TRUE, assumes k is in degrees; otherwise,
k is assumed to be in radians.}

\item{lngth}{the number of points to use when plotting
the ellipse.}

\item{draw}{if TRUE, draws a polygon in the shape of the
ellipse on an existing plot.}

\item{ret}{if TRUE, returns a matrix with the x and y
values for the ellipse.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for the polygon function.}
}
\value{
If \code{ret} is set to TRUE, returns the x and y-axis
  values that were passed into the \code{\link[graphics]{polygon}}
  function.
}
\description{
This function will draw an ellipse on a plot that
already exists.
}
\examples{
plot( c(-1,1), c(-1,1), type='n', xlab='X-axis', ylab='Y-axis' )
drawEllipse( .2, .2 )
ex = drawEllipse( .5, .2, Xc = -.5, Yc = .5, k = 20, ret = T, col = 'green')
drawEllipse( .05, .3, Xc = .5, Yc = -.5, k = 290, col = 'red')
